# About

This document contains information related to depthwise convolution (dwconv)
micro kernels.

# Depthwise Conv

Dw conv kernels operate directly on tensors stored in memory buffers. The RHS buffer is
normally pre-packed into a more efficient data layout taking into account vector length (or with interleaved bias).

# Naming

The naming of files has the convention below. Unless explicitly specified, arguments are mandatory.
The naming convention is largely similar to the matmul kernels, with a few new fields.

`kai_<op>_<fused_ops>_<dst_info>_<input_0_info>_<input_1_info>_<filter>_<stride>_<m_step x n_step>_<simd_engine>_<feature>_<instruction>.c`

| Syntax        | Description |Example   |
| --------------| ----------- |----------|
|op             |The main operation| matmul, imatmul, dwconv|
|fused_ops      |(Optional) Information on applied fused operations, e.g., activation functions| `clamp` |
|dst_info       |Description of destination buffer. See buffer descriptors. ||
| input_0_info, input_1_info, ... | Description of input buffers to the microkernel. In `matmul` routines, the LHS precedes the RHS. See buffer descriptors. ||
|filter         | Describes convolution filter used by kernel in the format 'h x w' ||
|stride         | Stride used by convolution operation |`s1` means a stride of 1.|
|m_step x n_step  | Output block size when the kernel is ran once. |`4xc` means the kernel produces 4 rows of output, calculating all channel values. Therefore `xc` means the kernel is planar.|
|simd_engine   | SIMD engine used to drive the computation  | `neon`, `sme`, `sme2`|
|feature        | (Optional) Further information about the Arm architecture feature used, often referred to as `FEAT_<feature>` in the specification | `dotprod`, `i8mm`|
|instruction    |Instruction used. This is optional|`mla`, `mopa`|

## Buffer descriptors

Input and output buffers can be described using the following form:

Example: `qsi4cxp` which means quantized symmetric (`qs`) signed integer 4-bit data (`i4`) with per channel quantization (`cx`) that has been packed (`p`).

Input buffer descriptors **must** also include information about how the data has been packed to more easily identify the required packing microkernels. In matmul routines this is done by appending `mrxkr` or `nrxkr` to the descriptor where `mr` represents the number of rows of LHS that are packed together, `nr` the number of columns of RHS that are packed together, and `kr` the number of columns of LHS or rows of RHS that are packed together.
