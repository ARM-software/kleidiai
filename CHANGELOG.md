# Changelog

KleidiAI follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) specification for releases.

## 0.1.0 - not yet released

The first release of KleidiAI includes:

- Micro-kernels to compute the matrix multiplication of:
  - Dynamically quantized 8-bit integer activations (QAI8DX) and quantized 4-bit integer weights (QSI4CX) and the
    accumulation of the result into a single-precision (F32) output, optimized for Arm® Neon™ technology.
  - Half precision floating-point (F16) activations and weights and the accumulation of the result into an F16 output,
    optimized for Neon technology.
  - F32 activations and weights and the accumulation of the result into an F32 output, optimized for SME2 technology.
- Tensor packing routines to prepare the activations and weights for input to the above matrix multiplication
  micro-kernels.
- Examples and documentation demonstrating the usage of the 4-bit integer and 16-bit floating point matrix
  multiplication micro-kernels.
- Testing suite.
